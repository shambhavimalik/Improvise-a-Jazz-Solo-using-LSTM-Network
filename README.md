# Improvise-a-Jazz-Solo-using-LSTM-Network
The aim is to implement a model that uses an LSTM to generate music.

## Problem statement

You would like to create a jazz music piece. However, you don't know any instruments or music composition. Fortunately, you know deep learning and will solve this problem using an LSTM network.  

You will train a network to generate novel jazz solos in a style representative of a body of performed work.

**Tasks:**
- Apply an LSTM to music generation.
- Generate your own jazz music with deep learning.
